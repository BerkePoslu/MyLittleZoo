Hey there! Welcome to HybridZoo, the fictional zoo where the animals are hybrids of two different animals. I created this open source school project to showcase my skills in web development, and I hope you enjoy exploring the website.

Project History:
This was a school project, where I needed to spent several weeks researching about said animals and design the website layout. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created an interactive website that showcases our unique collection of animal hybrids.
